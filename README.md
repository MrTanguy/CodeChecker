# CodeChecker

## Introduction

Faced with the various difficulties that we can encounter in our schooling,
plagiarism can be tempting. Nevertheless, it remains an offense which can and must be
punished. Specifically, within our training area, code plagiarism is
something that is unfortunately common.

We are two students,  and to overcome this problem,
we decided to develop a software allowing to signal
the main persons suspected of plagiarism.

To do this, a time limit was imposed on us, the project took place over 3 months and must therefore be finished by April 15th.
